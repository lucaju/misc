								<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Some kind of note</p>
						</note> letter from you since I left <placeName annotationId="ent_145" offsetId="ent_145" cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/2673722">Stockholm</placeName>, but I had a nice one from John in an envelope you had sent him. I had sent him one addressed to Copenhagen but he hadn't used it.</p><p>When I reached Oslo yesterday evening, Brynjulf Bull should have been there to meet me, but wasn't. He is not on the telephone, so I took a taxi to his address, which turned out to be a students' club with no one about on Sundays, so I went to a hotel feeling rather non-plussed. But presently he turned up. He had got the <pb n="2"></pb> time of my arrival wrong, and

					he had found he had missed me he phoned to every hotel in Oslo till he hit on the right one. He left me at 10, and then I had to do a Sunday Referee article. Today my journey lasts from 9 till 9 - fortunately one of the most beautiful railway journeys in the world. Tomorrow I lecture at <placeName annotationId="ent_144" cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6548528">Bergen</placeName> to the Anglo-Norwegian Society. Next day I go back to Oslo, lecture there Fri. and Sat. and then start for home via Bergen.</p>
