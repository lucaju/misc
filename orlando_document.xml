                     <P>A reader who has already met <TCHARACTERNAME>Rachel Cameron</TCHARACTERNAME> will know that she envies her married sister Stacey her sex life, her independence, and more especially her <TTHEMETOPIC>motherhood</TTHEMETOPIC>. This novel presents the life of <TCHARACTERNAME>Stacey Cameron MacAindra</TCHARACTERNAME> as she herself experiences it, as unappreciated servitude to four children and an inexpressive husband. A letter which Stacey writes to their mother, full of platitudes, is encountered in the first novel as Mrs Cameron reads it to Rachel, again in this novel as Stacey is writing it. <TTECHNIQUES>Stacey feels she is juggling with multiple selves, and the fictional technique is correspondingly fractured; <PRARITIESFEATURESDECORATIONS>the typography signals fantasies and news bulletins (about <TTHEMETOPIC>napalm and the threat of nuclear war</TTHEMETOPIC>) in italics and in capitals.</PRARITIESFEATURESDECORATIONS>

                     <P>Stacey's problems, involving the lives of many people, grow and multiply around her. A younger housewife, whose cool elegance she had envied, commits <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="suicide">suicide</TMOTIF>; she throws away her father's gun for fear she might use it to similar effect. The first person she confesses this to is a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>younger, hippie Italian man</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> with whom she has a <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="adultery">brief sexual fling</TMOTIF>. She worries about the noncommunicativeness of her husband, Mac (not till late in the story does she begin at last to understand the burden he carries of <TTHEMETOPIC>compulsion to be strong because he is male</TTHEMETOPIC>) and about the <TTHEMETOPIC>teenage blossoming</TTHEMETOPIC> of her daughter Katie. She fears for the safety of her two boys (as part of the book's composite climax, Duncan has a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>narrow escape from drowning</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>), and about the fact that her youngest child, Jen, is still mute at nearly three. Jen's first words (<QUOTE DIRECT="Y">Hi, Mum. Want tea?</QUOTE>) make a surprisingly moving moment: then she repeats the question and repeats it, till Stacey wonders: <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">Ye gods.

                        </BIBCITS> This is the Irish side of the family, her mother's side. Her father's side is Scottish.

They now live all the time with Grandfather and Grandmother Connor. Aunt Edna succeeds at last in getting away, marrying a man who unexpectedly turns out able to stand up to Grandfather. When Vanessa gets to dating, Grandfather taunts her that her boyfriend is probably married. She cannot forgive him for this, because it turns out to be true. The sequence ends many years later when the house is in other hands and, revisiting, Vanessa realises: <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">I had feared and fought the old man, yet he proclaimed himself in my veins.</QUOTE>

Snubbing the aunt (who was also a person <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>starved of affection</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>), Vanessa is painfully aware that this too, like every link in the chain before it, has been unfair.</P>
