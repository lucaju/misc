            <P>My work explores the intersections of myth and history. I am very interested in the question of the political or ethical responsibilities of art, how we intersect with totalitarianism, and whether there is a morality to beauty. I am interested in devised theatre, and how the work of the writer can be shaped by, and answerable to, the work of performers.</P>

The Archive was built around a secret. 'The Archive of Missing Things' is a contemplative game that happens undercover in a library. Equipped with an iPad and a headset, you have 90 minutes to explore a maze-like archive in search of the secret at its centre. Clues are everywhere: if you look and listen closely enough, you may just notice them. Created by Zuppa with Trillium-Award-winning writer Kate Cayley, 'The Archive of Missing Things' is an online book, a game, and an ambient performance for libraries in the age of rising sea levels."
